# Social-Rehab

Problem: People spend too much time on social media, and it negatively affects our dopamine levels.


Motivation: Social media is taking away our time, and we want that back!!


Why is it significant?

We can optimize our time by engaging in more productive activities, rather than succumbing to an endless cycle of wasting it on mindless scrolling through our electronic devices. By channeling our energy towards meaningful endeavors, we can enhance our efficiency and overall well-being, fostering personal growth and accomplishment. We can use our time for more productive activities instead of going into an endless cycle wasting it scrolling through our devices. 


Goal:  To reduce the amount of time students spend scrolling through social media on their devices.
